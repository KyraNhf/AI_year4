"""

Othello is a turn-based two-player strategy board game.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Board representation

We represent the board as a flat-list of 100 elements, which includes each square on
the board as well as the outside edge. Each consecutive sublist of ten
elements represents a single row, and each list element stores a piece. 
An initial board contains four pieces in the center:

    ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ?
    ? . . . . . . . . ?
    ? . . . . . . . . ?
    ? . . . . . . . . ?
    ? . . . o @ . . . ?
    ? . . . @ o . . . ?
    ? . . . . . . . . ?
    ? . . . . . . . . ?
    ? . . . . . . . . ?
    ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ?

The outside edge is marked ?, empty squares are ., black is @, and white is o.

This representation has two useful properties:

1. Square (m,n) can be accessed as `board[mn]`, and m,n means m*10 + n. This avoids conversion
   between square locations and list indexes.
2. Operations involving bounds checking are slightly simpler.
